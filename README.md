# fix-zbug3125

Workaround script for **Zimbra Bugâ€¯3125** â€” an issue affecting SNI (Server Name Indication) setups.

---

## Background: Zimbra Bug 3125

As documented in Zimbraâ€™s "Multiple SSL Certificates, Server Name Indication (SNI) for HTTPS" wiki, Bug 3125 impacts environments where some domains use Virtual Hosts while others donâ€™t, under SNI. The symptom: nonâ€‘SNI clients (or load balancer FQDNs) receive the first server block certificate, causing certificate mismatch and errors for clients like Appleâ€™s Mail. ([wiki.zimbra.com](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Multiple_SSL_Certificates%2C_Server_Name_Indication_%28SNI%29_for_HTTPS?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Immediate cause:** NGINX (used by Zimbra proxy) places the nonâ€‘SNI domain block at the top of  
`nginx.conf.mail.imaps` / `nginx.conf.web.https`, and uses that block for all nonâ€‘SNI requests, irrespective of which domain they target.

**Workaround:** Move the nonâ€‘SNI block to the top **manually**, then reload `zmproxyctl`, so that nonâ€‘SNI clients receive the intended (PublicServiceHostname) certificate.

## Script `fix-zbug3125.sh`

- Backs up the original config (`.bak`)
- Extracts the server block for a specified domain
- Removes it and prepends it to the top
- Fixes ownership and reloads the Zimbra proxy

**Important:** Run as `root`. Set `MX_DOMAIN="your.mail.domain"` before running.
